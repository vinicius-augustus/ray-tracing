# Ray tracing
In 3D computer graphics, ray tracing is a rendering technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects.

In this repository I will upload files of my studies on ray tracing and computer graphics using Julia High-level programming language.

In this repository, you will find the implementation, in Julia language, of the Ray Tracing algorithm based on the book [Ray Tracing in One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/) and on the playlist of a Brazilian channel on YouTube ["Programação Dinâmica"](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5TJqBvpXQv5zNlgvgH2HGuhZHpnkT3oo).
