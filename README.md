# Ray tracing
In 3D computer graphics, ray tracing is a rendering technique for generating an image by tracing the path of light as pixels in an image plane and simulating the effects of its encounters with virtual objects.

In this repository I will upload files of my studies on ray tracing and computer graphics using Julia High-level programming language.

Some of the codes found here were based on a playlist from the Brazilian YouTube channel **"Programação dinâmica"** https://bit.ly/3hTAk7U
